To be able to add or update translations or copywriting on your project, the contributor needs to have one of the following permissions on the Github repository:

- `Write` access
- `Maintain` access
- `Admin` access

Only having `Read` or `Triage` access is not enough as the contributor needs to be able to add new content via [git18n.com](https://git18n.com/) to the repository. If you are not sure what permissions your contributors have, you can check this in the Github repository settings under `Manage Access`:
