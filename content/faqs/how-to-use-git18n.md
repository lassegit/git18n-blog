The core philosophy behind git18n is to make translation management simple, less time
consuming and less costly. To achieve this we integrated translation with Github pull
requests. And also made sure that **zero setup** required, just sign in and try it out.

Developers, designers and product managers initially to focus on building the product and then
only as a last step (when the pull request is created) request a translation:

![Request translation with git18n.com](/request-translation.webp)

The translator then recieves an email containing a link to add translations. When the
translator has added the translations, the translator can "approve" the pull request
and the developer can merge it:

![Approve translation with git18n.com](/approve.webp)

Besides this, users can navigate their different repositories and pull requests and easily add
or request translation:

![List of pull requests translation on git18n.com](/approve.webp)

As the project is under quick development, I will try to update this when I add new features.
